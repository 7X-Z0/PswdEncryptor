# PswdEncryptor
This is a rewrite to my old personal high-school project into rust: 
https://github.com/7X-Z0/PasswordEncrypter.git

It is a test on how much programming I've learned throughout the years

Current update (5/14/2025): Encryption of string is finished.

Future plans:
Learn to create a key file and a way to store string to be accessed later.

Used what was learned to make a notepad-like program that encrypts all text made.

*needs to be easily accessible
*needs to be secure
